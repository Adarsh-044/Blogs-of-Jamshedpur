                            <p>Math, history, art—putting together a Fourth of July feast engages a multitude of skill sets for each learner. Have your child practice shape identification with watermelon blueberry stars or follow measurements for healthy
                                burgers. To set the table, learn the history and science behind candle making or decorate a patriotic themed picnic caddy. Young or old, the whole family will love making star garlands to decorate your home!</p>

                            <p>I love to use Social Studies. The founder, Amy Griffin, is a really good friend of mine. It’s awesome for entertaining at home, even if it’s just your family and you want the day to feel special. They send a kit with everything
                                you need to decorate a beautiful table—even flowers—with a guide on how to set it. Then you just rinse off the dishes, pack it up, and put it back in the mail. It's so easy, and it frees up your storage space.</p>

                            <h2>A new model for inclusive computer science education</h2>

                            <p>
                                The lack of diversity in the computing education pipeline has been a remarkably persistent problem. Something that’s stalled progress in addressing disparities is that there’s largely been a focus on individuals, such as teachers and students, rather
                                than on how equity plays out across multiple levels of the computer science (CS) education ecosystem. This is why our work at the University of Texas since 2014 focuses on understanding the root causes of inequities in
                                the CS education pipeline and how every level of the system influences equity.
                                <p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="contents">
                            <img src="/images/content_img2.jpg" alt="" class="content_img">
                        </div>
                        <div class="contents">
                            <p>At the time, we thought equity had to wait until we had solved the capacity, access and participation challenges. But as we began thinking more deeply about this model and asking our colleagues in the Expanding Computing Education
                                Pathways (ECEP) Alliance for feedback, we realized several things:
                            </p>

                            <p>True Equity is about more than just diversity in the classroom, and just because something is available to everyone doesn’t mean that everyone can or will benefit. Also, education is very complex and the things we can easily
                                measure (such as AP class participation) may not be the best indicators of change or success.</p>

                            <p>We developed a new framework that reflects how things connect at different levels of CS education. Most importantly, this model helps us better understand how equity plays out at each level. We’ve called it the CAPE framework
                                and it consists of four interdependent components: capacity for CS education, access to CS education, participation in CS education and experience of CS education. </p>
